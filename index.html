              JRKGBites is a mobile application designed to help you discover,
              rate, and manage a list of restaurants. Features include a
              Tinder-style swipe interface to like or dislike restaurants, a
              random "roulette" picker activated by shaking your phone, and
              search functionalities.

            </p>
            <ul class="my-3">
              <li>
                Device Feature Information: Our Service uses your device's
                accelerometer to enable the "shake-to-pick" feature. This motion
                data is processed on your device and is not stored or
                transmitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Biometric Information: If you choose to enable biometric login
                (e.g., fingerprint), the app uses the Android Biometric system
                to authenticate you. We do not collect, store, see, or transmit
                your biometric data (e.g., your fingerprint data) at any time.
                All biometric data remains securely stored on your device and is
                managed by the Android operating system.

              <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>

            <h2 class="h5">How We Store Your Information</h2>
            <p>
              All information related to your account and preferences is stored
              locally on your device. The current version of the application
              uses a "fake" authentication service for development purposes and
              does not transmit your personal data to a remote server.
            </p>

          <li>
            <h2 class="h5">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              JRKGBites does not use any third-party services for analytics,
              advertising, or data collection.

            <h2 class="h5">Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored on
              your device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure, and we
              cannot guarantee its absolute security.

          <li>
            <h2 class="h5">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of
              13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
              information from children under 13.
